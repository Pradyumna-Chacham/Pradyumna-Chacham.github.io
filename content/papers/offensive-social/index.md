abstract: "Offensive language, hate speech, and bullying are prevalent in online textual communication. This paper proposes a smart deep learning approach for the automatic detection of abusive content. We collected a labeled dataset from Twitter and extracted features using a word embedding mechanism. These embeddings were fed into a hybrid deep learning framework combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which achieved good results in classifying tweets as Offensive or Not Offensive."

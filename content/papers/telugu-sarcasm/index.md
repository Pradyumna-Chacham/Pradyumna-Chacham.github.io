abstract: "Sarcasm classification in non-English languages, like Telugu, presents NLP challenges due to data scarcity and model limitations. Our approach integrates FastText and IndicFT embeddings with various classifiers to detect sarcasm in Telugu. By addressing class imbalance through methods like undersampling, oversampling, and ensembling, we achieved balanced datasets and enhanced model performance, with SVM consistently attaining high accuracy."

abstract: "In the digital era, the surge of abusive content online underscores the necessity for robust content moderation. This study targets the challenges posed by abusive content in Telugu, a language with limited digital resources. The goal is an advanced framework to classify Telugu sentences as abusive or not, using FastText and IndicFast for word embedding and exploring various machine learning and deep learning techniques to capture the nuances of abusive language."

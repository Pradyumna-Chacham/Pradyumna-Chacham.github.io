This project focused on the challenging task of identifying offensive language in Telugu, a low-resource language. To overcome data scarcity, I employed several data augmentation techniques, including backtranslation, paraphrasing, and synonym replacement.

The core of the project involved fine-tuning advanced transformer models for classification. By leveraging the IndicSBERT model, the system was able to understand the nuances of the Telugu language and detect offensive content effectively, reaching a final accuracy of 82.64%.
